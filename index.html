    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <h2>Founders</h2>

    <p>
     Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin.
     We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em>, and probably more.

    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

    <p>
      Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
      Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
      <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
      introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
      <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
      plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
      are slightly exaggerated.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

    <p>
      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

    <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
